### this folder holds questions for interviewing a candidate on basic SQL with focus on the post-migration activities

I suggest three questions:
- count the records in a tabe grouping by a chosen column
- find duplicates in a table
- find differences between 2 tables (there are more than one viable solution here but one ideal)
