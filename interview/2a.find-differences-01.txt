The countries table was copied over to a table countries3. Both have the same definition, as follows:
	country_id CHARACTER (2) PRIMARY KEY,
	country_name CHARACTER VARYING (40),
Unfortunately some data was deleted from the new tables accidentally and you need to identify the rows that were accidentally deleted.
Write a SQL to list the rows that exist on countries but not in countries3.
